# ethberlin-hackathon-fractions

We are buidling a module which allows to fractionalize ownership of [IP-NFTs](https://github.com/IP-NFT?view_as=public).

IP-NFTs are a new funding tool which allows biomedical researchers to raise funds for their research through minting an NFT. This frees up researchers time from writing lengthy grant proposals and lets them focus on what they are passionate about - doing science. Ultimately, IP-NFTs will benefit society as a whole through increased R&D efficeny.

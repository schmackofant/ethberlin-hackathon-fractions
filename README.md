We are buidling a module which allows to fractionalize ownership of [IP-NFTs](https://github.com/IP-NFT?view_as=public).

The IP-NFT is a new funding tool that empowers biomedical researchers to raise funds for their research. The minting of an IP-NFT frees up researchers time and replaces the lengthy writing of grant proposals. It allows researchers to focus on what they are passionate about - **doing science**. IP-NFTs (Intellectual Property NFTs) store royalty and commericialisation rights of science projects and act as a vehicle for investors to deploy capital in early stage research. IP-NFTs will benefit society through increased research and development (R&D) efficeny and output as well as transparent, democratic funding mechanisms.

IP-NFTs have been applied successfully in the field through research DAOs like [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/).

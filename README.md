# ethberlin-hackathon-fractions

We are buidling a module which allows to fractionalize ownership of [IP-NFTs](https://github.com/IP-NFT?view_as=public).

IP-NFTs are a new funding tool that empowers biomedical researchers to raise funds for their research through an NFT mint. This frees up researchers time from writing lengthy grant proposals and lets them focus on what they are passionate about - **doing science**. IP-NFTs will benefit society through increased research and development (R&D) efficeny and output as well as transparent, democratic funding mechanisms.
